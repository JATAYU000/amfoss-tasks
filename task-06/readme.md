# CRICKEY

- The web scraping part was a breeze because I already knew how to use inspect and get the things needed in a website,and used Beautiful Soup (BS4) in Python to fetch data from a website. I quickly extracted the info I needed from a specific class.
- The challenging part was making the bot chat. I followed a tutorial to get the bot's token, set up the client, and programmed it to respond to chat input.
- When someone requested livescores, the bot sends them a private message with the cricket updates and csv part was easy since i already knew those.
- This project helped me learn about Python, APIs, and creating interactive bots on Discord
