# POKE-SEARCH
First, I set up the background and styled the buttons with the same stylesheet used in 'main.py'. Then, I added an input box and learned how to fetch Pokémon data from the API. But changing the background when you hit 'search' was not happening 
Then I had a genius idea: I threw a classic PokeGUI on top, and boom, it worked like magic. 
Capturing Pokémon was a bit of a puzzle with file handling and had to use os as some suggested in the internet, but I got it.
The real challenge was displaying Pokémon with those slick prev and next buttons. Thanks to Chat GPT, I found the 'index' method to navigate contents in a folder, and it all came together
