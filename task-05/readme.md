honestly, I barely knew anything about HTML to start with. I basically lived on Google, searching for how to do stuff like adding cool background pictures, putting in images, and making them clickable. It was pretty cool to see everything come together step by step, but I gotta admit, making those buttons look right took me a bit longer than I thought.Then there was the CSS part, which was surprisingly not as hard as I thought. It was like giving the website a makeover with colors and styles. But the real brain-buster was the shop part. I had to deal with this grid thing, and it was confusing as heck at first. Luckily, I found these YouTube videos that saved my life and helped me figure it out. All in all, this project taught me a ton about HTML and CSS, and it was a real eye-opener on how important it is to stick with it and use online resources when things get tough.
