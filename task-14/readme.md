# BANDIT
This task had many documentations in the internet so was quite easy
levels 0-3 were using cat command in diiferrent files like file name having space, hidden files etc
levels 4-6 were using find file command to specifically locate a file based on size,type,owner,group etc
levels 7-10 were using string command to loacte the password in data.txt
This experience has familiarized me with many useful commands that I can use in the future.
