# HELLO WORLD
-Completing this task was an interesting journey. 
-Python was a breeze, as I had prior experience from my school days and competitive coding tasks were also done python. 
-C, a part of our college curriculum, required some brush-up on basics, like for loops.
-C++ was where I had to grasp importing lists and adding elements. 
-Java, JavaScript, Ruby, and Elixir presented a moderate challenge since I started from scratch. I focused on what was necessary and managed to complete these languages.
-Haskell and Rust were the toughest to crack. I encountered numerous errors and spent a considerable amount of time researching solutions, but ultimately, I triumphed. 
-Go was very much similar to C but with some distinctions, making it relatively easier to handle.
-Overall, this task expanded my programming horizons, and while some languages demanded more effort, the satisfaction of conquering each one was worth the journey.
