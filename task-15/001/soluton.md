I could not get around the logic for this since my code had to be efficient unlike task 4.
so I added function which finds number of numbers divisible by 3 ,5 and 15 .
now since all the consequent multiples will be just addition of that number to the previous.
say for multiples of 3 till 10 => 3 + 6 +9 -> (1+2+3)*3
now add those of 3 and 5 which contains a duplicate values of common which 15 so subtract it.
