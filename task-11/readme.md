# TINKER-CAD
Tinkercad is one of the fun tasks in here, i actually enjoyed the building process except the code part of it.
For the code part of it, I first tried with blocks which looked like scratch animation coding .It filled me with nostalgia. 
But did it with c language finally but I was unable to rotate the motor 360 so I made it so that it rotates 180 to 0 and vise versa continuously when threshold value is greater than 500.
